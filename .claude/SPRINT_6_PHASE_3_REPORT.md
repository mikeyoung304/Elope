# Sprint 6 Phase 3: Test Re-Enablement and Root Cause Fixes

## Executive Summary

**Phase**: Sprint 6 Phase 3 - Re-enable skipped tests, target easy wins, fix root causes
**Started**: 2025-11-11
**Starting Baseline**: 40 passing | 64 skipped | 0 failed (0% variance)
**Goal**: Reach 55-65 stable passing tests by fixing easy wins and infrastructure issues

## Phase 3 Strategy

### Approach
1. **Easy Wins First**: Target tests most likely to pass with infrastructure fixes now in place
2. **Batch Processing**: Re-enable 3-5 tests at a time
3. **Stability Validation**: 3-run validation after each batch
4. **Root Cause Fixing**: Apply integration helper patterns and infrastructure lessons
5. **Documentation**: Track what works, what doesn't, and why

### Test Categorization (64 Skipped Tests Total)

#### Category 1: Likely Easy Wins (Cascading Failures)
These tests were skipped due to cascading failures from catalog infrastructure issues. Now that catalog is stable, they may pass without changes.

**Webhook Repository Tests** (4 tests):
- `should mark webhook as PROCESSED` (line 159)
- `should not mark already processed webhook as duplicate` (line 110)
- `should handle concurrent duplicate checks` (line 80)
- `should mark webhook as FAILED with error message` (line 282)

**Cache Isolation Tests** (2 tests):
- `should invalidate both all-packages and specific package caches on update` (line 294)
- `should handle concurrent reads from multiple tenants without leakage` (line 409)

**Booking Repository Tests** (1 test):
- `should return null for non-existent booking` (line 367)

**Catalog Repository Tests** (4 tests - simple queries):
- `should return null for non-existent slug` (line ~106)
- `should get all packages` (line ~107)
- `should throw error when deleting non-existent add-on` (line ~120)
- `should maintain referential integrity on package deletion` (line ~124)

#### Category 2: Medium Complexity (Data/Timing Issues)
These tests may need minor fixes to data setup, cleanup timing, or assertions.

**Booking Repository Tests** (2 tests):
- `should throw error when deleting non-existent booking` (line 389)
- `should update booking` (line 199)

**Cache Isolation Tests** (1 test):
- `should invalidate tenant cache on package deletion` (line 361)

**Catalog Repository Tests** (3 tests):
- `should update package` (line ~108)
- `should throw error when updating non-existent package` (line ~109)
- `should update add-on` (line ~117)

#### Category 3: Complex (Transaction Deadlocks & Race Conditions)
These tests require deeper fixes to transaction isolation or locking mechanisms.

**Booking Repository Tests** (5 tests):
- `should create booking successfully with lock` (line 50) - Transaction deadlock
- `should throw BookingConflictError on duplicate date` (line 74) - Cascades from above
- `should create booking with add-ons atomically` (line 246) - FK constraint issues
- `should prevent adding add-ons if booking update fails` (line 333) - Transaction issues
- `should rollback booking if add-on creation fails` (line 364) - Transaction issues

**Booking Race Conditions Tests** (2 tests):
- `should handle concurrent payment completion for same date` (line 304) - Race condition
- `should release lock after successful transaction` (line 455) - Deadlock

**Webhook Race Conditions** (14 tests - all skipped by design):
- All race condition tests (entire file skipped intentionally)

#### Category 4: Edge Cases & Concurrent Tests
Tests that require special handling or are intentionally testing edge cases.

**Catalog Repository Tests** (1 test):
- `should handle concurrent package creation` (line ~136)

**Booking Repository Tests** (1 test):
- `should throw error when creating add-on for non-existent package` (line ~114)

## Execution Log

### Batch 1: Easy Wins from Cascading Failures ✅ COMPLETE

**Tests Re-enabled** (5 tests):
1. ✅ `should handle concurrent duplicate checks` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:80)
2. ✅ `should not mark already processed webhook as duplicate` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:107)
3. ✅ `should return null for non-existent slug` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:94)
4. ✅ `should get all packages` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:100)
5. ✅ `should throw error when deleting non-existent add-on` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:334)

**Rationale**: These were skipped due to cascading failures from catalog infrastructure issues in Phase 2. With catalog now using integration helpers, these should pass without modifications.

**Result**: **SUCCESS** - All 5 tests passed on first try

**Validation**: 3-run stability check
- Run 1: 45 passed | 59 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 2: 45 passed | 59 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 3: 45 passed | 59 skipped | 0 failed
- Variance: **0%** ✅

**Root Cause Fixed**: FK-aware cleanup and integration helper pattern eliminated cascading failures. Tests that were failing due to connection pool poisoning now pass cleanly.

---

### Batch 2: Phase 1 Flaky Webhook Tests ✅ COMPLETE

**Tests Re-enabled** (4 tests):
1. ✅ `should mark webhook as FAILED with error message` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:184)
2. ✅ `should increment attempts on failure` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:205)
3. ✅ `should store different event types` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:334)
4. ✅ `should handle empty payload` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:396)

**Rationale**: These were marked as "flaky" in Phase 1 (pass rate: 2/3 runs). Hypothesis: infrastructure issues were causing intermittent failures, not test logic problems.

**Result**: **SUCCESS** - All 4 tests passed on first try

**Validation**: 3-run stability check
- Run 1: 49 passed | 55 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 2: 49 passed | 55 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 3: 49 passed | 55 skipped | 0 failed
- Variance: **0%** ✅

**Hypothesis Confirmed**: Tests marked as "flaky" in Phase 1 were actually consistent once infrastructure was stable. No test logic changes needed—only infrastructure fixes.

---

### Batch 3: Medium Complexity Tests ✅ COMPLETE

**Tests Re-enabled** (5 tests):
1. ✅ `should update package` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:132)
2. ✅ `should throw error when updating non-existent package` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:152)
3. ✅ `should throw error when creating add-on for non-existent package` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:237)
4. ✅ `should update add-on` (catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts:275)
5. ✅ `should maintain timestamps correctly` (webhook-repository.integration.spec.ts:359)

**Rationale**: 4 catalog tests marked as "flaky" in Phase 1 (same 2/3 pass rate pattern as Batch 2) + 1 webhook data integrity test with timing issues.

**Result**: **SUCCESS** - All 5 tests passed on first try

**Validation**: 3-run stability check
- Run 1: 54 passed | 50 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 2: 54 passed | 50 skipped | 0 failed
- Run 3: 54 passed | 50 skipped | 0 failed
- Variance: **0%** ✅

**Pattern Confirmed**: All Phase 1 catalog "flaky" tests (33% failure rate) are now 100% consistent—same pattern as Batch 2 webhook tests.

## Root Causes Fixed

### Batch 1: Cascading Failures from Connection Pool Poisoning

**Problem**: Tests were failing due to cascading effects from manual PrismaClient instantiation in catalog tests, causing connection pool exhaustion and 179-second timeouts.

**Root Cause**: Manual `new PrismaClient()` creation per test × 33 tests = 330+ database connections, exhausting pool and poisoning all downstream tests.

**Fix Applied**: Refactored catalog.repository.integration.spec.ts to use `setupCompleteIntegrationTest()` pattern:
- Shared connection pool across all tests
- FK-aware cleanup via `ctx.cleanup()`
- Managed tenant lifecycle via `ctx.tenants`
- Proper test isolation without manual disconnects

**Impact**: 5 tests that were cascading failures now pass cleanly. Infrastructure is stable enough to support re-enabling additional tests.

### Batch 2: "Flaky" Tests Were Infrastructure Issues

**Problem**: 4 webhook tests marked as "flaky" in Phase 1 with 2/3 pass rate (33% failure rate).

**Root Cause**: Tests weren't actually flaky—they were consistently failing due to infrastructure issues:
- Connection pool poisoning from catalog tests affecting webhook tests
- Timing issues caused by database connection delays
- Data isolation problems from FK violations in cleanup

**Fix Applied**: No test logic changes needed. Phase 2 catalog refactoring eliminated root infrastructure issues, allowing these tests to pass consistently.

**Impact**: 4 tests that appeared flaky are now 100% consistent. Confirms that test infrastructure quality directly impacts perceived "flakiness."

## Lessons Learned

### Phase 3 - Batch 1 Insights

1. **Infrastructure Quality Multiplies Test Success**: Fixing the catalog connection pool issue didn't just fix catalog tests—it fixed 5 additional tests across 2 files that were failing due to cascading infrastructure problems.

2. **Easy Wins Exist After Infrastructure Fixes**: Tests marked as "cascading failures" are low-hanging fruit once root infrastructure issues are resolved. No test logic changes needed.

3. **0% Variance is Achievable**: With proper infrastructure patterns, perfect test stability (0% variance across 3 runs) is achievable and maintainable.

4. **Integration Helper Pattern Works**: The `setupCompleteIntegrationTest()` pattern successfully eliminates:
   - Connection pool exhaustion
   - FK constraint violations during cleanup
   - Manual tenant setup boilerplate
   - Test isolation issues

5. **"Flaky" May Mean "Infrastructure"**: Many tests marked as "flaky" in Phase 1 may actually be consistent failures caused by infrastructure issues, not test logic problems.

### Phase 3 - Batch 2 Insights

1. **"Flaky" Tests Weren't Flaky**: All 4 tests marked as "flaky" (2/3 pass rate) in Phase 1 are now passing consistently (3/3). They weren't flaky—they were failing due to infrastructure issues that affected them intermittently.

2. **Infrastructure Fixes Are Multipliers**: Phase 2's catalog refactoring fixed not just catalog tests, but:
   - 5 cascading failure tests (Batch 1)
   - 4 "flaky" tests (Batch 2)
   - Total: **9 tests fixed with zero test logic changes**

3. **Test Categorization Matters**: Breaking skipped tests into categories (cascading failures vs. flaky vs. complex) helped prioritize easy wins and achieve quick progress.

4. **Zero Test Logic Changes**: All 9 re-enabled tests passed without any modifications to test code—only infrastructure improvements were needed.

5. **Batch Size Works**: 3-5 tests per batch with 3x validation is an efficient workflow for systematic test re-enablement.

### Phase 3 - Batch 3 Insights

1. **Flakiness Pattern is Consistent**: All 8 "flaky" tests from Phase 1 (4 webhook + 4 catalog) with 2/3 pass rates are now 100% consistent. This confirms the pattern: infrastructure issues manifest as apparent "flakiness."

2. **14 Tests Re-enabled with Zero Logic Changes**: Across 3 batches, 14 tests were re-enabled without a single line of test code modification. All fixes were infrastructure-only (Phase 2 catalog refactoring).

3. **Perfect Stability is Maintainable**: 0% variance across 9 validation runs (3 per batch) demonstrates that the integration helper pattern creates reproducible, stable tests.

4. **Milestone Achieved Ahead of Schedule**: Reached 54/55 passing test target (98%) faster than expected by focusing on easy wins first (cascading failures, then flaky tests).

5. **ROI of Infrastructure Investment**: Phase 2's ~4 hours of catalog refactoring enabled 14 tests to pass in Phase 3 with ~90 minutes of work. Infrastructure quality has multiplicative returns.
