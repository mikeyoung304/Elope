# Test database (separate from development)
# This should point to a separate test database to avoid contaminating dev data
# NOTE: Currently using dev database for local testing - acceptable in development
#
# ⚠️ CONNECTION POOL CONFIGURATION FOR INTEGRATION TESTS - REQUIRED!
# Integration tests create many Prisma Client instances sequentially.
# Without these limits, tests exhaust the database connection pool causing:
#   - PrismaClientInitializationError: Too many database connections
#   - Test regressions (tests that were passing start failing)
#   - Unstable test results
#
# Recommended settings for test environment:
#   connection_limit=10   - Max connections per Prisma Client (default 100+ causes exhaustion)
#   pool_timeout=20       - Seconds to wait for available connection (default 10)
#
# See: test/helpers/README.md § Troubleshooting § Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
#
# IMPORTANT: Add connection_limit and pool_timeout query parameters to your DATABASE_URL_TEST
DATABASE_URL_TEST="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20"

# Test environment flag
NODE_ENV=test
